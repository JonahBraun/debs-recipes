          <h2>Greens with Goat Cheese Croutons</h2>

<div class="recipe">
A little tedious to make, however if you like goat cheese, it's worth it.<br />
Vinaigrette: <br />
1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice <br />
1 small shallot, minced <br />
1 clove garlic, minced <br />
2 teaspoons Dijon style mustard <br />
1 tablespoon minced fresh parsley leaves <br />
Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste <br />
1/4 cup walnut oil<br />
<br />
In a small bowl, whisk together lemon juice, shallot, garlic, mustard,
parsley, and salt and pepper. Add walnut oil in a stream, whisking
until it is emulsified (I used my blender for this). Set aside or
refrigerate until ready to use. If refrigerating, bring to room
temperature before using. <br />
<br />
Salad Ingredients: <br />
2 small heads of Boston lettuce, wash well,&nbsp; spun dry, and shredded fine <br />
1 small head of radicchio, washed well, spun dry, and shredded fine <br />
<br />
In a large bowl, toss the lettuce and the radicchio with the
vinaigrette. Place salad mixture on individual salad plates. Top with
Goat Cheese Croutons. <br />
<br />
Goat Cheese Croutons: <br />
2 (3-inch) soft goat cheese logs <br />
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil <br />
1/4 cup fine bread crumbs <br />
1/4 cup nuts (walnuts, pecans, hazelnuts), ground <br />
<br />
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.&nbsp; Cut the goat cheese into 1/2-inch
slices. (Tip: Use dental floss to slice the cheese logs cleanly.) Pour
olive oil into a small bowl or saucer; dip goat cheese slices into
olive oil and coat both sides of each cheese slice. In another small
bowl or saucer, combine bread crumbs and nuts; dip the goat cheese
slices into the crumb mixture. <br />
Place the cheese croutons on a lightly oiled baking sheet. (NOTE: the
croutons may be refrigerated at this point for 1 hour). Bake for
approximately 6 minutes or until the cheese softens slightly and the
crust turns deep golden. Remove from oven and transfer croutons to
individual salads with a spatula. Serve immediately.
