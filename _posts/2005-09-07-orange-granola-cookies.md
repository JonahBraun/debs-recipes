This is Simone's favorite granola cookies recipe.  Healthy treats for the kids!

- 2 ¼ c *all-purpose flour
- ⅔ c sugar
- ½ c butter
- ¼ c orange juice (or 1/2 orange - remove and reserve zest to add to batter later. Remove remaining peel then puree orange until smooth) 
- 1 t baking powder
- ½ t ground cinnamon
- ½ t baking soda
- ½ t salt
- 1 egg
- 1 c granola cereal
- ½ c raisins
- ½ c quick cooking rolled oats

Beat sugar, butter, egg, and orange juice in large mixing bowl. Add all other ingredients and mix throughly. Drop dough onto greased cookie sheet with teaspoon, about 2 inches apart. Flatten mounds slightly with a fork. Bake at 350° for 10 to 15 minutes, until lightly browned. Remove to rack with spatula and let cool completely. Store in tightly covered container for up to 1 week.

Makes about 3 dozen granola cookies. 

*I substitute 1/2 cup whole wheat flour for white flour.  It doesn't affect the taste and improves the nutititional value.
