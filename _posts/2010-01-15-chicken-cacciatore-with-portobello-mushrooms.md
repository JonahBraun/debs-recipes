category: poultry
---
Serves 6
  
- 8 bone-in, skin-on, chicken pieces
- salt and pepper to taste
- 2 T olive oil
- 1 medium onion, chopped
- 3 medium portobello mushrooms, stems and gills removed, diced into 3/4 inch cubes
- 4 cloves of garlic, minced
- 2 T flour
- 1½ c dry red wine
- ½ c chicken broth
- 1 14.5 oz can diced tomatoes, drained
- 2 t minced fresh thyme leaves
- 2 t minced fresh sage leaves
- 1 Parmesan cheese rind
  
Preheat oven to 325 F.

Season chicken with salt and pepper. Heat olive oil in an ovenproof skillet over medium high heat.

Fry half the chicken or what fits in the pan in a single layer skin side down, until skin is crisp and well browned; about 5 minutes. Turn and brown second side, about 5 minutes longer.

Transfer to a large plate and repeat with remaining chicken. Remove chicken from pan.

Add onion, mushrooms, and 1/2 t salt to the chicken skillet. Saute over medium high heat, stirring occasionally, until the moisture evaporates and the vegetables begin to brown; about 6 to 8 minutes. Add garlic and saute 30 seconds until fragrant. Stir in the flour and cook, stirring constantly for a minute or so. Add wine, scraping the pan with a wooden spoon to loosen the browned bits. Stir in broth, tomatoes, thyme, pepper to taste, and Parmesan rind.

Add chicken pieces and accumulated juices, submerging chicken in the liquid. Bring to a simmer, cover and place pot in oven.

Bake about 40 minutes or until chicken is done. Remove Parmesan rind. Stir in the sage.

Taste and adjust with salt and pepper.

Serve while hot with pasta or rice.
