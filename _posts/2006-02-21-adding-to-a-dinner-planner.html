title: Adding to a Dinner Planner
category: alt
---
Now that you have a 3 week dinner planner established you will want to
add to it until you have at least 5 weeks on dinners on your list.<br />
<br />
The best way to do this is to try a new recipe once a week or every couple of weeks.&nbsp; If you like it add it to the list.<br />
<br />
You can get new dinner ideas from magazines, newspapers, friends, cook books or on the web.<br />
<br />
It is important that new additions are not too difficult to make or
require hard to find ingredients.&nbsp; Don't put a dinner on the
planner until you have tried it.&nbsp; You may not like it or it may be
too cumbersome to make.<br />
