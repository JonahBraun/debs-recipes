<p>Deb grew up on the Canadian prairies on a steady diet of rather bland European foods.  When she hit the big city as a young adult her insatiable curiosity and desire for change prompted a rash of experimentation with cooking and diet.  As a result, husband Ed and their four growing children thrived on a vegetarian diet for about a decade before settling into their present diet of mostly natural and organic foods of all kinds.</p><p>Good cooking is catchy, so as the kids grew older they often contribute (along with their spouses) to the family recipe collection. </p>
