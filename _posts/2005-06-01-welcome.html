<em><strong>Welcome to our family recipe site!&nbsp;</strong></em> The recipes you will find here are
some of our favorites, and those our friends and family keep asking
for.&nbsp; We love experimenting with different flavors, colors and
textures.&nbsp; Many of&nbsp; the recipes combine traditional European foods
brought to the<img border="0" align="left" src="../../../images/stories/food/img_0003.jpg" /> Canadian prairies with our ancestors, with foods, spices
and herbs from around the world.&nbsp;&nbsp; All recipes are developed
with nutrition in mind, therefore processed foods and ingredients are
avoided as much as possible.<br />
