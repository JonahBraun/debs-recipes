Delicious and very rich!<br />
<p>Serves 6</p>


<p><em>Ingredients</em>:<br />
1 2/3 cups heavy whipping cream<br />
1 1/4 cups whole milk<br />
1/2 cup&nbsp;sugar<br />
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract<br />
8 ounces Valrhona semisweet chocolate, coarsely chopped<br />
6 large egg yolks</p>


<p><em>Method</em>:<br />
Preheat the oven to 250&deg;F/120&deg;C.&nbsp;In a medium saucepan, combine the
cream, milk, sugar and vanilla. Whisk to blend and bring to a boil over
medium heat.&nbsp;Add the chopped chocolate and whisk until all the
chocolate has melted.&nbsp; Remove from the heat.<br />
<br />
In a large bowl, lightly beat the egg yolks. Then, in a slow, steady
stream, add the chocolate-cream mixture, whisking until smooth.&nbsp;Divide
the mixture among 6 ramekins or small custard bowls (about 6 ounces
each), and place them in a large high-sided baking dish or baking pan.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Make a bain-marie, or water bath, by pouring cold water into the baking
dish so that it comes halfway up the sides of the ramekins or custard
bowls.&nbsp;Cover tightly with foil and bake on the center rack for 50
minutes to 1 hour, or until the custards jiggle slightly in the center
when gently shaken (the custards will thicken as they chill).<br />
<br />
Let cool to room temperature and then refrigerate until cold.&nbsp;&nbsp;Serve cool.</p>
