Not low fat, not low sugar, not high fibre, and not healthy ... just a real old fashioned treat! 

- 1¼ c flour
- ¼ c brown sugar
- ½ c butter

Mix together and pat into a 8" square pan. Bake at 350 degrees for 15 minutes.

While the crust is baking, mix the next 7 ingredients in a separate bowl. Spread over hot baked crust and return to oven. Bake for 20 - 30 minutes until golden and bubbly.
