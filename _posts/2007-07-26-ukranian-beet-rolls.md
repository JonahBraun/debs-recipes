These are best when the beets are fresh out of the garden.

- dough for one loaf
- 2 dozen small beet leaves or larger ones cut in half
- ½ c chopped green onions
- salt and pepper to taste
- ½ c chopped green onion
- ¼ c chopped fresh dill
- butter
- 1 c whipping cream
- Salt and pepper to taste.

Prepare bread dough. When ready for forming, roll into a long log. Cut into 24 small log shaped pieces. Loosley wrap a beet leaf around each dough log and place into buttered pan leaving 1/2 inch space between each log.

Let rise for 30 minutes.

Meanwhile saute onion in a tablespoon of butter until onion is soft. Remove from heat, add dill, salt, pepper and cream. Set aside.

Bake rolls in 350 degree oven for 15 minutes. Remove from oven. Pour cream mixture over rolls. Turn oven off and return rolls to oven for 10 minutes so that cream will warm and absorb somewhat into rolls.
