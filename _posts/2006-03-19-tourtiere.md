Nice and spicy, this main dish just needs a salad or vegetable on the side to make a meal.

- 1½ lbs lean ground pork or beef and pork mixed
- 1 large onion, minced
- 1 celery stalk, minced
- 1½ t pureed garlic 
- ½ minced jalapeno or ½ t red pepper flakes (optional) 
- 1 t salt
- ½ t coarse black pepper
- ½ t thyme
- ½ t ground cloves
- ¼ t ground allspice
- 1 cup mashed potatoes 
- 1 tbs oil
- pastry for a double crust or 8 sheets phylo pastry

Brown meat, onion, and celery. Add garlic and jalapeno,
salt, pepper, thyme, cloves and allspice. Stir well.

Add mashed potatoes, mixing well.
Cool slightly. 
While cooling, make pastry. Roll out half the pastry and line a pie tin. Transfer the pork mixture to unbaked pie shell.
Roll out other half of pastry to top the pie. Put several slits into the top of the pie shell to vent.

Bake 20 minutes at 425. Reduce heat to 350 and bake another 20 minutes.

If using phyllo pastry, place 8 sheets one on top of the other alternating lengthwise and widthwise, brushing lightly with olive oil between sheets. Pile the filling in the centre of the phyllo then fold the phyllo sheets up around the filling brushing edges with a little water to glue the sheets together. 

Bake at 375 until the pastry is browned and crispy.
