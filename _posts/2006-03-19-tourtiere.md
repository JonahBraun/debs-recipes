- 1½ t pureed garlic 
- ½ minced jalapeno or 1/2 t red pepper flakes (optional)

Brown pork, onion, mushrooms and celery. Add garlic and jalapeno,
salt, pepper, thyme, cloves and allspice. Stir well.

Add broth and bring to the boil. Add potato flakes and reduce heat to simmer, stirring occasionlly until the flakes have thickened the
mixture.

Turn off heat.Cool slightly. 
While cooling, make pastry. Roll out half the pastry and line a pie tin. Transfer the pork mixture to unbaked pie shell.
Roll out other half of pastry to top the pie. Put several slits into the top of the pie shell to vent.

Bake 20 minutes at 425. Reduce heat to 350 and bake another 25 to 30 minutes.

If using phyllo pastry, place 8 sheets one on top of the other alternating lengthwise and widthwise, brushing lightly with olive oil between
sheets. Pile the filling in the centre of the phyllo then fold the phyllo sheets up around the filling brushing edges with a little water to glue the sheets together. 

Bake at 375 until the pastry is browned and crispy.
