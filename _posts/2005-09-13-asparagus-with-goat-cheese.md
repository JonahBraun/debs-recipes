---
An elegant side dish.&nbsp; Great with lamb or beef.

- 2 pounds asparagus stalks, washed and trimmed
- 3 T extra-virgin olive oil
- Coarse kosher salt (regular salt also works, just doesn't look as nice)
- Coarsely ground black pepper
- 1 (3 to 4 oz) log soft fresh goat cheese, crumbled
- 2 t fresh lemon juice
- 1 t grated lemon peel

Cook bacon in heavy large skillet over medium heat until brown and crisp. Transfer to paper towels to cool. Crumble bacon; set aside. 
Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 400 degrees F. 
Arrange asparagus on large rimmed baking sheet. Drizzle with 2 tablespoons olive oil and turn asparagus to coat well. 
Sprinkle generously with salt and pepper. 
Roast asparagus until crisp-tender when pierced with knife, about 7 minutes.
Remove from heat and arrange asparagus in single layer on platter.
Sprinkle with goat cheese, then bacon. Drizzle with lemon juice and remaining 2 teaspoons oil. Sprinkle grated lemon peel over.  Cover with plastic wrap. Let stand at room temperature.
Can be prepared 1 hour ahead.
Makes 6 servings.
