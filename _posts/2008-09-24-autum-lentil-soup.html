<p>This yummy lentil soup is really hearty and flavorful.  Serve with fresh whole grain bread and you will have a protein rich meal in a bowl.</p><table border="0"><tbody><tr><td> 1/2 cup brown lentils<br /></td><td>1 cup red lentils <br /></td></tr><tr><td> 1 medium onion, chopped            <br /></td><td>2 cloves garlic, chopped<br /></td></tr><tr><td> 2 carrots cut into rounds<br /></td><td>1 cup  squash (any kind except spaghetti squash) peeled and chopped </td></tr><tr><td> 1/3 cup tomato paste </td><td>2 tbs. miso (I used Brown Rice Miso)<br /></td></tr><tr><td> 2 cubes beef bouillon (or vegi) <br /></td><td>2 tbs. olive oil<br /></td></tr><tr><td> pepper to taste<br /></td><td>water<br /></td></tr></tbody></table><p> Saute onion and garlic in oil.  Add all other ingredients and enough water to cover twice*.  Bring to a boil, then cover and place in 250 degree oven for 2 hours.   This recipe would work well in a crock pot.  Just put all the ingredients in the pot.  Start on high for 1/2 hour then turn to low for a couple of hours or until you are ready to eat.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.</p><p>* Add enough water so that you have twice as much water as you have lentils and vegetables.  After the soup has cooked for an hour or so, you can add more water if it seems too thick. </p>
