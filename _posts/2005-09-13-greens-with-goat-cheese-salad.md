category: salads
---
A little tedious to make, however if you like goat cheese, it's worth the effort.

Vinaigrette:

- 1 T freshly squeezed lemon juice
- 1 small shallot
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 2 t Dijon style mustard
- 1 T minced fresh parsley leaves
- Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
- ¼ cup walnut oil

In a small bowl, whisk together lemon juice, shallot, garlic, mustard, parsley,salt and pepper. Add walnut oil in a stream, whisking
until it is emulsified (I used my blender for this). 
Set aside or refrigerate until ready to use. If refrigerating, bring to room temperature before using.

Salad Ingredients: 

- 2 small heads of Boston lettuce, shredded fine
- 1 small head of radicchio, shredded fine

In a large bowl, toss the lettuce and the radicchio with the vinaigrette. Place salad mixture on individual salad plates. Top with Goat Cheese Croutons. 

Goat Cheese Croutons:

- 2 (3-inch) soft goat cheese logs 
- ¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil
- ¼ cup fine bread crumbs
- ¼ cup nuts (walnuts, pecans, hazelnuts), ground

Preheat oven to 400 degrees. 
Cut the goat cheese into 1/2-inch slices. (Tip: Use dental floss to slice the cheese logs cleanly.) 
Pour olive oil into a small bowl or saucer; dip goat cheese slices into olive oil and coat both sides of each cheese slice. 
In another small bowl, combine bread crumbs and nuts. Dip the goat cheese slices into the crumb mixture.
Place the cheese croutons on a lightly oiled baking sheet. 
Bake for approximately 6 minutes or until the cheese softens slightly and the crust turns deep golden. 
Remove from oven and transfer croutons to individual salads with a spatula. 
Serve immediately.
