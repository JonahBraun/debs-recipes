This is cousin Gabrielle's yorkshire pudding recipe; the best I've had so far.<br />
<br />
Gabrielle says, &quot;Usually when I take my roast out of the oven is when I
put mine in, it gives the roast a nice time to cool for cutting and
both are ready at the same time&quot;.
<table border="0"><tr><td>2 eggs <br />
</td><td>1 cup milk <br />
</td></tr><tr><td>1 cup flour <br />
</td><td>1/2 tsp salt <br />
</td></tr><tr><td>1 tbs water <br />
</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr></table><br />
Mix all ingredients (except water) early in the day and refrigerate.&nbsp;
Mix periodicately during the day. When ready to bake cover a cast iron
pan with oil or drippings from the roast ( maybe 2 tbsp, enough to
cover the pan nicely) and heat in oven.&nbsp; Get the oil nice and hot.&nbsp;
Just before baking add the water and mix and pour mixture into hot
pan.&nbsp; Bake for 20 minutes or until puffy and browned, at 400 degrees.<br />
