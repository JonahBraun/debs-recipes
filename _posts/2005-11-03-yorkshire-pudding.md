A family recipe from cousin Gabrielle. Gabrielle says,"I put my yorkshire pudding in the oven when I take the roast out.  This gives the roast a chance to rest before carving."

- 2 eggs
- 1 c milk
- 1 c flour
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1 T water

Mix all ingredients (except water) early in the day and refrigerate. Mix periodicately during the day. 

When ready to bake, preheat muffin tin in oven along with the roast.

Remove the roast and muffin tin. Turn oven up to 400 F. Drizzle muffin tin with a bit of oil (can get this from the roast). Return the tin to the oven for a minute or two to heat the oil.
Remove dough from the fridge and add the water. Mix and pour into hot muffin tin.

Bake for 15 to 20 minutes or until puffy and browned.
