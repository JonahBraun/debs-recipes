  Bring 2 L water to a boil and add the wild rice.  Summer, uncovered, for 20-25 minutes until al dente or the rice starts to bloom.  Drain well and set aside.  In a large heavy saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter.  Add the onion, celery, carrot, mushrooms and garlic and saute until tender, about 5-6 minutes.  Add the white rice, pepper, sage and thyme. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat and simmer, covered, for 15 minutes or until the white rice is soft.  Stir in the dried cranberries, toasted almonds and chopped parsley.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Remove from heat, cover, and allow to rest for 5 minutes before serving. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
