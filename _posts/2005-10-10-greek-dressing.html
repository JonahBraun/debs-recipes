This dressing is by far the best Greek Dressing I've tasted.&nbsp; <br />
<table width="300" height="100" border="0"><tr><td>&nbsp;4 tsb lemon juice<br />
</td><td>1 tsp dried oregano <br />
</td></tr><tr><td>4 tbs red wine vinegar <br />
</td><td>1/4 tsp garlic powder <br />
</td></tr><tr>
      <td>1 tsp salt<br />
      </td>
      <td>1/2 c olive oil<br />
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1/4 tsp pepper<br />
      </td>
      <td>1/4 c crumbled feta cheese<br />
      </td>
    </tr>
</table><br />
Place all ingrediants in a blender except for olive oil and feta
cheese.&nbsp; With the blender running, slowly add olive oil. This is
important to do to properly mix the oil with the dressing. After well
mixed, add feta cheese.<br />
