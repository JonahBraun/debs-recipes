This recipe works well with peaches or fresh sour cherries as well.

- 4 c quartered pitted prune plums
- ½ t salt
- 2 T quick cooking tapioca or 2 T cornstarch
- ⅓ c orange juice
- 2 T unsweetened shredded coconut
- 1½ c flour
- 3 t baking powder
- 2 T sugar
- 2 t grated orange rind
- ⅔ c milk
- pouring cream (optional)


Heat oven to 400 degrees.  Butter a 12 X 7 baking dish; add plums. Mix 1/4 cup sugar, tapioca and orange juice. 

Drizzle over fruit. 

Mix flour, baking power and sugar into a medium bowl. Add shortening and cut in finely. Stir in coconut and orange rind. 

Add milk and mix lightly with fork to make a soft, puffy dough.Knead gently. Roll or pat into an oblong slightly smaller than baking dish and cut into 6 squares. Lay squares over fruit. Cut a small slash in centre of each and sprinkle lightly with sugar.

Bake until topping is nicely browned and fruit is bubbling; about 25 minutes.
