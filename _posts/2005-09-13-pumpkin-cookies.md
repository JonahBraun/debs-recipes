Fall means a ready supply of pumpkins.  Rather than just carve them for Halloween, try a new pumpkin recipe!  This one is absolutely delicious.

- 1⅓ c sugar 
- 1½ c whole wheat flour
- 1 c butter
- 2 tsp. baking soda
- 1¾ c fresh cooked pumpkin
- 2 tsp. ground cinnamon
- 2 tsp. vanilla extract
- ¾ lb semi-sweet chocolate chips 
- 2½ c white flour
- ¾ c chopped walnuts

Cream together sugar, butter, pumpkin and vanilla extract.  Mix until light and well combined.  Mix the flour, baking soda and ground cinnamon in a separate bowl.  Sift the flour mixture into the creamed mixture.  Mix until combined.  Stir in the chocolate chips and nuts.  Drop by teaspoons onto an ungreased baking sheet.  Bake 12-15 minutes at 375F.
