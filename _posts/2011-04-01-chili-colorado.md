Serves 6

This recipe is for a slow cooker.

- 2 T vegetable oil
- 2 lb lean stewing beef, trimmed of fat and cut into 1 inch cubes
- ¼ c water
- 3 to 4 c red chile sauce (recipe below) or one 28 oz can of red chile sauce or enchilada sauce
- 4 to 5 medium russet potatoes, peeled and cut into 2 in chunks
  
Put the potatoes into the crock. 

In large heavy skillet, heat the oil over medium high heat. Pat the beef cubes dry with paper towels. Add half the beef to the skillet and allow to brown well on all sides, about 5 minutes. As the beef browns, remove it with a slotted spoon to the slow cooker. Repeat with the remaining beef.

Add the water to the pan, and bring to a boil, scraping up any browned bits stuck to the pan. Pour into the crock. Add the chile sauce to the skillet, bring to a boil and pour it into the crock. Cover and cook on low for 5 to 7 hours.

Note. If the sauce you are using is too spicy, you can also substitute some of the sauce for stewed tomatoes.

Red Chile Sauce

- ¼ c vegetable oil
- 2 cloves garlic, finely minced
- ¼ c flour
- 1 c red chile powder; not regular chile powder, but actual ground red chiles, found at Paraiso Tropical in Edmonton
- 4 c water
- salt to taste

In large skillet heat the oil over medium high heat. Add the garlic and cook, stirring for 1 - 2 minutes, do not let it brown. Stir in the flour. Reduce the heat to medium and add the chile powder, chile burns very easily, so keep stirring. Stir in the water. Raise the heat to medium high and let the sauce come to a simmer. Season with salt.

The sauce is ready to use as is, but if you want a thicker sauce, let it summer for 10 - 15 minutes.

The sauce will keep in an airtight container in the fridge for 1 week, or frozen up to 3 months.
