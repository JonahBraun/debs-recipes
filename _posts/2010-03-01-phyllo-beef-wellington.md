Somewhat time consuming to put together, but the results are both elegant and tasty.

- 4 beef tenderloin steaks 1" thick, seasoned with salt and pepper
- 1  ½ inch slice of pancetta, diced
- 4 c sliced brown mushrooms
- ½ t salt
- 2 c finely sliced leeks; white part only
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 2 T chopped fresh parsley
- 1 T chopped fresh rosemary
- 1 T chopped fresh thyme
- ½ c white wine
- 2 T cold butter, cubed
- 4 sheets phyllo pastry, thawed
- olive oil for brushing
  
In a large heavy lightly oiled skillet, sear the steaks over high heat until nicely browned on both sides. Remove from the skillet and set aside on a plate.  Reduce the heat to medium-high. Add the pancetta and cook for about 2 to 3 minutes until lightly crisp. Add the sliced msuhrooms to the skillet and stir to combine with the pancetta. Saute for about 3 minutes until the mushrooms release their moisture and begin to brown. Add the leek, garlic and herbs and cook for about 3 minutes until soft and fragrant. Add wine scraping up the browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Let reduce for a minute or two until most, but not all, of the liquid has evaporated.

Remove from the heat and whisk in the butter cubes. Let cool to room temperature.

Turn out the mushroom mixture onto a large cutting board and roughly dice.  Divide the mushrooms evenly over top of each of the steaks. Wrap each steak in plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator to chill.

Preheat oven to 400 F. On a large work surface, brush 4 sheets of phyllo pastry lightly with olive oil. Cut the sheets lengthwise down the centre and stack on top of each other. Cut the stacked phyllo into 4 squares. Unwrap the chilled steaks and place each in the centre of 1 stacked phyllo square. Wrap phyllo around each steak and scrunch the pastry on top.

Place Wellingtons on a parchment lined baking sheet and bake for 10-12 minutes until the pastry is well browned and the steak is cooked to 145 degrees.
