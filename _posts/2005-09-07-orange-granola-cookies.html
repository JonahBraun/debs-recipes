This is Simone's favorite granola cookies recipe.  They are super healthy and great tasting.  <br />
<ul> <li>*2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li><li>2.3 cup sugar</li><li>1/2 cup butter</li><li>1/4 cup orange juice (or 1/2 orange c/w rind, blended until smooth) </li><li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li><li>1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li><li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li><li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li><li>1 egg</li><li>1 cup granola cereal</li><li>1/2 cup raisins</li><li>1/2 cup quick cooking rolled oats</li> </ul> <br /> <p><strong>PREPARATION:</strong></p> Into a large mixing bowl, measure flour, sugar, butter, orange juice, baking powder, cinnamon, baking soda, salt, and egg. With electric mixer at low speed, beat ingredients until well blended, scraping bowl occasionally. Stir in granola, raisins, and oats. <p> Drop dough onto greased cookie sheet with teaspoon, about 2 inches apart. Smooth mounds slightly with fingers. Bake at 350° for 15 to 20 minutes, until lightly browned. Remove to rack with spatula and let cool completely. Store in tightly covered container for up to 1 week.</p> <p> Makes about 3 dozen granola cookies. </p> * I substitute 1/2 cup whole wheat flour for white flour.  It doesn't affect the taste and improves the nutititional value.
